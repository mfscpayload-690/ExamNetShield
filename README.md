## 📘 Overview

This project proposes a secure, scalable, and centralized framework for conducting lab-based examinations using **network booting** (Netbooting) via the **Linux Terminal Server Project (LTSP)**.

By booting all lab systems from a centralized, tamper-proof image, we eliminate inconsistencies, local vulnerabilities, and manual setup overhead. A custom-built **Flask web app** and **Epoptes** classroom monitoring tool enable full visibility and control throughout the exam lifecycle.

> 🎓 Mini project submitted to **APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University**, 2025.

## 🛠️ Installation

### 📌 Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Debian-based OS (for LTSP server setup)
- PXE-compatible client systems
- VirtualBox (for building custom client images)

### 🚀 Quick Start with Docker

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mfscpayload-690/ExamNetShield.git
    cd ExamNetShield
    ```

2. **Configure environment**
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    # Edit .env and set your SECRET_KEY and other configurations
    ```

3. **Run with Docker Compose**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

4. **Create admin user**
    ```bash
    docker-compose exec web python create_user.py
    ```

5. **Access the application**
    - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`
    - Default credentials: username: `sharon`, password: `sharon` (change after first login)

### 🐍 Manual Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mfscpayload-690/ExamNetShield.git
    cd ExamNetShield
    ```

2. **Create virtual environment**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Configure environment**
